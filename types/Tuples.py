'''
Tuples are very similar to lists, except that they are immutable (they cannot be changed).
Also, they are created using parentheses, rather than square brackets.

# Example:1
words = ("spam", "eggs", "sausages",)
print(words[0], '\n')

words[1] = "cheese"

# create a list, dictionary, and tuple:


# list
list =[

    "one", "two"

]

# dictionary
dict ={

    1: "one", 2: "two"

}

# tuple
tp =(

    "one", "two"

)
